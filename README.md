# Wakeboard Bucket List

This is a list of tricks I want to be able to do and tricks I already know. They come in several
variations for most. I only validate a trick if I can do it **at least three times in a row
correctly**.

The list doesn’t have _all possible_ tricks. The unticked ones are the ones I’m currently learning.
I’ll add more as I unlock this bucket list.

_Variations_ are things I can add to any trick to modify them and make them funnier and more interesting.

> - _SW_: switch.
> - _TS_: toeside.
> - _SW TS_: switch toeside.
